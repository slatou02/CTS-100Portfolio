                <h2>Visualization Critique</h2>
                <p>The chosen data visualization is a spatial structure designed by NASA, likely for a general audience,
                     displaying the temperature change on a global map between 1970 to 2018. This visualisation is 
                     directly related to the keyword climate change. NASA is widely regarded as a reliable source worldwide. 
                </p>
                <p>The data in this visualisation is depicted on a Robinson Projection, where both shape and area are warped. 
                    This causes transitions between values to appear longer or shorter than the reality; however, the distortion 
                    on a Robinson Projection is minimal around the middle latitudes where the majority of the target audience is 
                    concerned (Meirelles 119). The visualisation appears to be using an Isometric map depiction of the data (Meirelles 148). 
                    This depiction is logical as temperature is a continuous distribution of data. Overall, given the choices made, 
                    this is an effective visualisation for displaying relative positioning of temperature increases to the audience. 	
                </p>
                <p>Taking into account the choices made in representing the data, there are issues that arise in the visualisation. 
                    Firstly, since the data is continuous, the colour on the graph is a gradient and should be defined in the legend as such,
                     using a gradient across the colours and marking points on the gradient with the corresponding value. This change eliminates 
                     confusion about shades that do not appear in the original legend for the visualisation. Additionally, 
                     the colour representing no temperature change, +0°C, is the same as the colour representing no data. This creates an 
                     unreliability in the visualisation, since the viewer cannot be sure which value to interpret when seeing that colour on 
                     the graph.
