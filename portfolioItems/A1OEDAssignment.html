                <h2>Three sources for device in the OED</h2>
                <p>“The devices for baling cut hay.”</p>
                <p>
                    Knight, E H. “Bale-Tie.” <em>Knight’s American Mechanical Dictionary</em>, 1874, https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hb1oti&view=1up&seq=248&urlappend=&num=218&u=1. Accessed 23 Sept. 2025. 
                </p>
                <p>This source was found by clicking directly through the OED. The quote is from a dictionary of mechanical devices that
                     catalogues them and provides summaries, diagrams and descriptions of each device. This source is significant because it
                      illustrates the keyword device, in one of its most common use cases, a device as a tool designed for a function or task.
                       This source also shows that a device does not need to be complicated, even something as simple as a tool for bailing hay
                        is a device. In contrast, devices can also be far more complex things like a smartphone, computer, or a calculator. 
                        This affects my understanding of the keyword because it reminds me that a device does not need to be electronic, 
                        which is so easy to forget in today’s modern society. 
                    </p>
                <p>“It was a lodge of ample size, But strange of structure and device.”</p>
                <p>Scott, Walter. “Canto I. The Chase.” <em>The Lady of the Lake</em>, 1810, https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.31175035208837&seq=9. Accessed 23 Sept. 2025. </p>
                <p>
                    This source was found by using the cited information that was alongside the quoted text in the OED to search in the library
                     for the full text to read the quote in context. The library linked to this site where the chapter and page number provided
                      in the OED was used to find the quote in the context of the whole book. This source is a six canton poem written by 
                      Walter Scott in 1810. This poem is significant because it demonstrates vivid imagery using elaborate terms including
                       a unique use for the keyword, device, to describe the way a thing is framed or appears in a situation. 
                       This use of the keyword serves as a midpoint between situational and objective technological use. 
                       This affects my understanding of the word device beyond that of meaning a tool with a function and how it was applied 
                       as something more vague like how a thing is devised.

                <p>“We will walk after our own deuices.”</p>
                <p>“Jeremiah 18.” <em>Bible (King James)</em>, 1611, https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%2018&version=KJV. Accessed 23 Sept. 2025. </p>
                <p>
                    This source was found by using a web search to access an online king James bible and using the webpage’s tools
                     to find the specific passage in its context. This quote is from the bible which is a religious text that is the root
                      of many modern day religions and is of major cultural significance. This particular quote demonstrates the use of 
                      the word device as something more abstract instead of a physical or tangible thing. In this context, 
                      a device refers to a person’s own inclination or will. Although this use for the word device is present in a very old text, 
                      it still finds its way into modern conversations in phrases such as: leaving somebody to their own devices. 
                      This affects my understanding of the word because it shows the timelessness of abstract definitions of the word.
