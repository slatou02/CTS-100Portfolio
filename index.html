        <h2>Knowledge and skills</h2>
        <p>
        I have a solid foundation in programming, web development, and modern software practices. I have experience with C, Java, and python, building efficient programs while applying key concepts like data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented design. I also have experience with HTML and CSS to create responsive, user-friendly websites with clean structure and modern styling.

        </p>
        <p>
          I am comfortable with Git for version control, using it to track changes, manage multiple branches, and resolve conflicts efficiently. This experience allows me to support collaboration and maintain smooth project workflows in team settings, ensuring code quality and consistency across projects. I am also familiar with integrating Git into collaborative platforms like GitHub or GitLab, which enables seamless code reviews, issue tracking, and continuous integration processes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have experience with Agile development, including iterative workflows, sprint planning, and team collaboration. I am also familiar with DevOps practices such as continuous integration, deployment, and workflow automation, which help ensure reliable and maintainable software. By combining practical skills with solid development practices, I focus on delivering high-quality, scalable, and effective software solutions.

      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        I am a 20-year-old software engineering student at the University of Guelph with a strong passion for programming and problem-solving. I grew up in Sarnia, Ontario, and graduated from St. Patrick’s High School on the honour roll, where I developed a solid academic foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond my studies, I have a deep appreciation for animals, My family has a Shepherd and I take care of a small bioactive aquarium. Music is another significant interest; I collect vinyl records and have been learning to play bass guitar.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also value time spent outdoors with my family at our cottage in northern Ontario. Activities such as fishing, boating, canoeing, and exploring trails on ATVs allow me to connect with nature.
      </p>
      <p>
      I am currently seeking my first co-op employment opportunity in software engineering. I am eager to apply my technical skills, gain practical industry experience, and contribute to projects that challenge me to grow professionally while making a meaningful impact.
